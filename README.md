## 🔒 Security

- **ABAC**: Doctors can only access patients they are assigned to or have appointment history with
- **HttpOnly Cookies**: Tokens stored securely — immune to XSS
- **Record Versioning**: Medical records are never hard-deleted; amendments create new versions
- **Helmet + CORS + Rate Limiting**: Production-ready API protection
- **Input Validation**: Zod schemas on all endpoints

> **⚠️ Compliance Note**: This is a portfolio/educational project and is **not automatically HIPAA or GDPR compliant**. Production deployment would require BAAs, security audits, encrypted-at-rest storage, and comprehensive access logging.
